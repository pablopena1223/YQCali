                <p class="bio">Hello! My name is Yanelly Quintanilla, I’m a New York City-based calligrapher, lettering artist, and recent graphic designer. </p>

                <p class="bio">Growing up, my parents always pushed me to have nice penmanship and eventually from there I learned how to write in script. 
                As I got older, I became interested in lettering and design, but it wasn’t until my senior year of high school where I fully immersed myself in art. 
                I have been specializing in hand-lettering and chalk art for well over 5 years, with developing skills in graphic design. 
                A great deal is put into the art of drawing letters, in order to create eye-catching signs. </p>

                <p class="bio">Thankfully, after starting my small calligraphy business, I've been able to work closely with clients such as Starbucks, 
                Grace's Marketplace, and have helped many clients have a little piece of art for their special occasions. </p>

                <p class="bio">Lettering and design is truly my passion; if there’s a canvas to work on, I’m always up for the task. </p>
